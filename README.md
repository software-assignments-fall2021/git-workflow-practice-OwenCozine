Here is the [link](./https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210803121404.htm) to the article I found interesting.

## Response
I find this article interesting because I had never seen anything like it before. I didn't know that it was possible to use classical computers to emulate some quantum algorithms. I though the entire point of quantum computers was that they couldn't be emulated on classical ones. The idea of using advanced machine learning to have a classical computer learn how a quatum one will work is very impressive and innovative.
